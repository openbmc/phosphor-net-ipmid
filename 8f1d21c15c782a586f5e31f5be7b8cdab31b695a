      "message": "This case statement updates the settings for the SOL manager, but does not actually update the SOL manager (unless you do a get on the params, which then invokes an update.)\n\nWe should probably set the settings in the sol manager here as well, or make the call (as in the get conf params below) to update the settings in the sol manager from dbus. I would prefer the former, since it involves fewer dbus calls.",
