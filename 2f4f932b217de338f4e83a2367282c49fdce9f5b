The code that you are removing is so that a close session call can be made from one channel and close a session on another channel. Without that code, it is not possible for the various netipmid instances to do this.\n\nIf you are running out of sessions on a single interface just because of an ending session, this seems like there is another bug in the code. It should not be invoking closeOtherNetInstanceSession to close the current session. That should be calling closeMyNetInstanceSession.",

I thought that would be blocked since the dbus stuff will break it?\n\nAlso for closing one sesson from one channel to another, wouldn\u0027t all of the sessions be fetchable from session::Manager::get().getSession(reqSessionId)?",

      "message": "On some systems, we have two instances of netipmid running simultaneously, one for each of the network interfaces the BMC has access to. netipmid was designed so that it binds to a single network interface only, so any system that has more than one ipmi network channel will have this as well.\n\nI understood the symptoms of your issue from the test case you used for resolution, but I don\u0027t know why it would be doing that. It should not be calling into the closeOtherNetInstanceSession at the end of a session. That is reserved for some session attempting to close another session by embedding a close session command with some other session ID inside a session.",
